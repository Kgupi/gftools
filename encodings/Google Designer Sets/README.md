# Google Designer Character Sets

====================================================

Three levels of character support were developed as a new baseline standard for fonts in the Google Fonts Library. Exising fonts in the library should upgrade their character sets inline with the new quality standards. All new fonts submitted to the Library should support the **Plus** level as a minumum requirement.

**Plus**, **Pro**, and **Expert** sets are available in this folder.
**Filter Lists** folder contains a text file with a list of glyphs for each character set. 
In Glyphs paste and copy this list as a list filter, and check if your fonts supports these characters. 
All the names in these lists are compatible with the Glyphs App naming scheme.
