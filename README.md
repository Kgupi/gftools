# Tools

This directory contains miscellaneous tools for working with the Google Fonts collection.
**Glyph set documentation is in the encoding subdirectory.**

## Requirements and Dependencies

These tools are intended to work with Python 2.7 systems. 
While these tools may work with Python 3.x, if so, that's a happy accident.
Pull Requests welcome! :)

These tools depend on the submodule `GlyphsInfo`.
Make sure the submodule is up to date by running:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Also `compare_font.py` and `sanity_check.py` have additional dependencies that can be installed with pip:

    sudo easy_install pip;
    pip install --user google-apputils protobuf git+git://github.com/behdad/fonttools.git;

## Sample Usage

Compare fonts:

    python compare_font.py font1.ttf font2.ttf;

Add a METADATA.pb to a family directory

    python add_font.py ../ofl/newfamily;

Sanity check a family directory:

    python sanity_check.py --repair_script=/tmp/fix.py ../ofl/josefinsans;
    python sanity_check.py --repair_script=/tmp/fix.py --fix_type=fsSelection ../ufl;
